## How to use this guide

This guide will support you in understanding our API, how and when to use them. The first of many API which are being exposed to approved partners allows for the calculation of a broker customers servicing arrangement, and to create a servicing quote. You can then direct your broker to this quote page, which will allow them to progress to the OwnHome broker platform to complete this calculation.
